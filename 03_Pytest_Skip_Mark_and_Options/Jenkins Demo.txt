STEPWISE PROCESS: Automating Python Tests in Jenkins
STEP 1

Installed Jenkins on Windows system.

STEP 2

Started Jenkins as a Windows service.

STEP 3

Opened Jenkins in browser using:

http://localhost:8080

STEP 4

Unlocked Jenkins using initialAdminPassword.

STEP 5

Installed suggested Jenkins plugins.

STEP 6

Logged in as Admin and reached Jenkins dashboard.

STEP 7

Prepared Python project at:

test_xxx() functions

STEP 9

Used pytest features:

assertions

markers (skip, skipif, xfail)

pytest.ini

STEP 10

Created a new Jenkins Freestyle Job.

STEP 11

Named the job:

Python-Unittest_job

STEP 12

Configured build step using Custom Python Builder.

STEP 13

Set Python path and executed pytest command:

python -m pytest -v --junitxml=test_report_1.xml "D:\PyTest-Practice"

STEP 14

Ran the job using Build Now and executed all tests.

STEP 15

Published test results using JUnit report and viewed results in Jenkins.

Where Test Reports Are Stored

XML file location:

C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Python-Unittest_job\test_report_1.xml
